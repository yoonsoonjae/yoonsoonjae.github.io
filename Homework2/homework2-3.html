      The job market is changing rapidly as AI technology continues to evolve, 
      with professional occupations requiring a high level of expertise being 
      the most likely to be replaced by this technology, according to industry 
      officials and experts, Thursday.<br>
      
      <br>The Korea Institute for Industrial Economics & Trade (KIET) said in its 
      March 13 report that the number of jobs in Korea that could be replaced 
      by AI technology is 3.27 million, accounting for 13.1 percent of all jobs.</br>
      
      <br>The state-run institution pointed out that the adoption rate of AI by domestic 
      companies was at only 4 percent in 2022, but the rate will be expanded soon due 
      to the performance improvement of AI and consequently AI will likely replace an 
      increasing number of jobs.</br>

    <p><br>The government has selected three local festivals — Incheon Pentaport Rock Festival, 
      Suwon Hwaseong Cultural Festival and Hwacheon Sancheoneo Ice Festival — to develop into global 
      tourism events as part of its three-year project aimed at doubling the number of inbound visitors 
      and accelerating the regional economy.</br>
    
      <br>The Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism and the Korea Tourism Organization (KTO) said Thursday 
      that a global festival council will be formed to work with organizers of the three festivals and unfold 
      a strategic marketing campaign overseas by the end of 2026.</br>

      <br>The government will provide each festival with 660 million won ($500,780) this year and launch their 
      international showcases.</br>
